I am switching to another [tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) with active [git](https://github.com/Overv/VulkanTutorial).
It seems to support Wayland. Basically starting from scratch.

Later maybe try [raytracing](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io).

## Dependencies
sudo apt-get install libvulkan-dev vulkan-validationlayers-dev libglfw3-wayland libglfw3-dev vulkan-sdk
